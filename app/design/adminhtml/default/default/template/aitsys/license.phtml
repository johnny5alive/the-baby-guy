<h3>2. License</h3>
<h4 style="padding-left:20px;">2.1. General Issues</h4>

<h4 style="padding-left:20px;">2.2. License Options</h4>

<p>Products contain necessary controlling functionality to provide the Customer with the exact number of parameters indicated in the License Option. The functionality will make sure the Customer does not exceed the allowed number of parameters.
